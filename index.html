			<h1>About Me</h1>
			
			<img id="mePic" src="assets/me.jpg"  alt="selfie">
			<p>William Leung is an aspiring Full Stack Developer at UCLA Extension Coding Bootcamp. Previously, William worked as a Quality Lab Technician for Spectrum Labs Inc which manufactures filtration products in the biotech field. He graduated from University of California, Irvine with a Bachelors degree in Chemical Engineering. Alright, now he's done with the boring stuff. </p>

			<p>Will spends time web coding, photographing, youtubing, redditing and more hermit-like activities. Side note, he learned hodl is the best way to invest his bitcoins. Once in a while, he likes to get out of the house for some sun and fresh air. Also, he is an all time foodie on a budget and has a guilty pleasure for tasty coffee and boba. For boredom, he plays Overwatch but sometimes play LoL when he needs his more salt intake.
